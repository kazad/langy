# Summary of Scott and Kalid's Discussion on Vibe Coding

During your meeting, you discussed building a language learning app with Scott Young, particularly focused on Chinese vocabulary learning. Here are the key vibe coding tips that emerged:

## Vibe Coding Tips:

1. **Start with specs and planning**: Create a specs document first, then make a plan document before writing any code
2. **UI-first approach**: Build the interface before backend logic to ensure it feels right
3. **Multiple design options**: Generate 3-5 different UI designs to compare rather than committing to one approach
4. **Feedback collection**: Build in tools to collect, export, and review feedback on designs
5. **Incremental development**: Start small and expand gradually rather than building everything at once
6. **Use local storage**: Leverage browser storage for user data before implementing server components
7. **Consolidate regularly**: Periodically review and clean up the codebase with fresh eyes
8. **Store API keys in .env files**: Keep sensitive information like API keys in environment files that aren't checked into repositories
9. **Plan mode vs. Edit mode**: Use "plan mode" to outline changes before implementing them
10. **Evolve algorithms**: Let multiple approaches compete rather than committing to one perfect algorithm

You demonstrated these principles while building a prototype for Scott's language learning app concept, which uses a Bayesian model to track vocabulary knowledge and adapt to the user's level.
