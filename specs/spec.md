- Based on your discussion, you're planning to build a language learning app with these key features:

  1. **Adaptive Learning System**: Unlike traditional flashcard apps, this will use a Bayesian model to track what words the user knows. It will have:
     - A database of words ranked by frequency (using Zipf's Law)
     - A probability model that estimates which words you know
     - Dynamic updating of this model based on user performance
  2. **Contextual Learning**: Instead of isolated flashcards, words will be presented in sentences to provide context, especially important for languages like Chinese where connotation matters.
  3. **Implementation Plan**:
     - Start with Chinese (good first choice because it lacks inflection complications)
     - Use AI (like OpenAI) to generate contextual sentences
     - Use tools like Jieba to tokenize Chinese text (since it doesn't have spaces)
     - Build a user profile system that tracks knowledge over time
     - Include time decay so the system knows when knowledge might be forgotten
  4. **Technical Approach**:
     - Start with the UI/interface first (paper prototype approach)
     - Build a simple HTML interface initially
     - Add Python backend for the Bayesian model logic
     - Connect to AI APIs for sentence generation
     - Consider GitHub for version control and sharing
  5. **Future Extensions**:
     - Add modality-specific knowledge (reading vs. listening)
     - Expand to other languages (Spanish would need inflection handling)
     - Potentially adapt the model for other domains like mathematics

  The goal is to create something that works well on mobile (since you'll use it in short bursts), can be used without being a "power user" of flashcard systems, and automatically adjusts to your knowledge level.
